Version: 1.0

Name: Page Reader

Description:
This is a simpler extension which helps your reading pages. When you move your mouse over a link in a page, a little message will show up. It will tell you the address of the link, the title of the target page, and some abstrctions(up to 3).
The popup will not show up until the target link is completely loaded.Thus, sometimes, the popup will show up a little latter if the internet condition is bad.

Limitations:
~~~a. I have try my best to make it react to your mouse action as quickly as possible. However, it sometimes does look like dummy, especially when you move your mouse too quickly. So please don't get upset when it happens. Move your mouse at normal speed and it will get all right.~~~

b. I use content script to inject some javascript code into the current page. However, sometimes it doesn't work, especially Google Search Result Pages. I don't know why...
